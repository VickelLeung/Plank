# About
This project is used as an assessment for Plank.

# Approach

My first approach to this assessment is to divide and conquer, meaning each component is separate into smaller chunks. Before I begin coding, I make sure I know what kind of components are needed and what goes inside the component. For example, I made a CardItem and CategoriesItem which both contain elements within that can be used to fill in the data given.

I also made a container called WorkPage which contains all information that was needed to display webpage. Afterward, I started working with the API and retrieving the information to populate the CardItem & CategoriesItem. The last thing I have worked on being on the CSS to style the website and make it web/mobile compatible.

# Issues tracking

Trello was used during this assesment to keep track of all issues and keep track of what is left to do.

Netlify was used to deploy the most recent build for the assessment

# Information on how to get the app started below
=======================================================================================================================================================================

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
